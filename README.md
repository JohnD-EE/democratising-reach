# Democratising Reach

## 1. Why: Let the smartest voices be heard

#### 1.1 Celebrity, power and tactics
The number of people you can 'reach' and infulence on social media is largely determined by the size of your followership. Your followership on any given platform is determined by a range of factors. Your celebrety status, for example, will determine your ability to reach others and broadcast your views, regardless of their truthfuless. You may use your pre-existing power, wealth or eminence in the 'old media' world to brute force the growth of your followership. Or you may simply have the time and resources available to deploy those tactics most likely to influence the accumulation of followers - courting controversy, causing outrage, trolling, regurgitating BS, or pure unrelentic persistence. When you scroll through social media, it just doesn't feel right - deep down we know we're being emotionally hijacked, manipulated and divided as people.

A small propotion of users have an assymetric power of reach.

### 1.2. The politicisation of content, and algorithms designed to optimise outrage
Social media algorithms are not designed to deliver the best content, but the content which is most likely to trigger people emotionally and grab as much attention as possible. Furthermore, platforms have political leanings and with the emergence of 'cancel culture' we so those holding opposing views to the mainstream narrative being 'de-platformed' either through algorithm bias or direct censorship. We are unduly influenced by emotionally charged political biases and the questioning voices of dessent are being silenced.

#### 1.3 Signal from noise
We may also see a followership accrued throgh truthful, insightful, creative, thoughtful, humourous, convicial, and balanced argument. Content which informs, amuses, and provokes discussion. However, such content will not have sufficient reach if its creator does not have celebrity status, wealth, or the time and tactics to build an audience. Insightful gems of content are lost forever in the turbulent throthy seas of social media. 

## 2. What: A social media platform where the best content can reach the most people

#### 2.1 Aligning reach with quality
Reach on social media platforms is proportionally related to celebrity, wealth and tactics rather than the quality of content. The essence of this proposal is to create a social media patform where reach is directily proportional to quality. Scrolling through quality content will ignite our higher selves, elevate our understanding of the world, and encourage empathy for our fellow humans.



## 3. How: The mechanics of the platform




## 3. Who: People who believe in seeking the truth 

Blind Microblogging


### Brain Dump
Twiitter launched in 2006 as a microblogging service where people could broadcast status updates to their followers in 140 characters or less.

#### So what is wrong with Twitter and its clones?
* The platforms are rife with abusive attacks and trolling
* People being deplatformed for having the 'wrong' opinion on things - if the US President can be deplatformed then we are all vulnerable
* The platforms become an echo chamber where through their following choices and algorythmic suggestions, people are only exposed to opinions which confirm their own biases
* A small propotion of users have an assymetric power of reach, influence and impact due to their followership or celebrity status, rather than through the truth or insight in what they have to say say.  Valuable input from people with low reach (followership) cannot get the readership it might deserve.
* The platforms are mired by fake accounts, and accusations of being hijacked by bots run by foreign agents which shape public opinion and influence election results.
* The platforms themselves have evolved to have particular political leanings, or at least the perception of political bias based on the views of their user base or the policies the platforms have implemented.
* The platforms have become a noisy mouthpiece for marketing messages and the promotion of brands




There have since been many Twitter copycats such as Parler, Gab, Mastodon etc...  However these seem to be variations on the main Twitter theme with various implementation differences; E.g. Mastodon is Open Source, Parler and Gab are less prone to censorship and thus attract more right and hard-right leaning opinion in opposition to the perception that Twitter is more left, and hard-left leaning.
